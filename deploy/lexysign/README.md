## Repo state

- Base branch: `staging`
- Prep branch: `lexysign-hetzner-prep`

## Prepared files

- `apps/OpenSign/Dockerfile.lexysign` — builds the LexySign React client from this fork, not upstream OpenSign images.
- `apps/OpenSignServer/Dockerfile.lexysign` — builds the customized server from this fork.
- `deploy/lexysign/docker-compose.yml` — self-contained Mongo + server + client + Caddy stack.
- `deploy/lexysign/Caddyfile` — routes `/api/*` to server and everything else to client.
- `deploy/lexysign/.env.example` — no real secrets.
- `deploy/lexysign/lexysign-generate-env.sh` — generates `.env`, random `MASTER_KEY`, and a throwaway P12 for smoke tests.
- `apps/OpenSignServer/cloud/customRoute/deleteAccount/deleteFileUrl.js` — guards S3 client creation so local-file deployments can start with `USE_LOCAL=true` and no object-storage credentials.
- `apps/OpenSignServer/cloud/parsefunction/loginWithSupabase.js` — validates shared Supabase access tokens and bridges them into Parse sessions.
- `apps/OpenSignServer/billing/*` and `apps/OpenSignServer/cloud/customRoute/billing.js` — Stripe checkout/portal/webhook routes plus monthly usage entitlements.
- `apps/OpenSign/src/pages/Billing.jsx` — subscription/usage UI.
- `apps/OpenSignServer/cloud/parsefunction/DocumentBeforesave.js` — enforces active subscription and records e-sign usage when signed documents are created.

## Deploy runbook

On local machine:

```bash
cd /Users/bot/work/peacock-sign
git status --short --branch
git push -u origin lexysign-hetzner-prep
```

On Hetzner:

```bash
ssh -i /Users/bot/.ssh/id_ed25519_hostinger root@37.27.49.209
mkdir -p /opt/lexysign
cd /opt/lexysign
git clone --branch lexysign-hetzner-prep https://github.com/peacockesq/peacock-sign.git .
cd deploy/lexysign
HOST_URL=https://sign.lexyalgo.com bash ./lexysign-generate-env.sh
# edit .env for Supabase, Stripe, and SMTP before any real users
# point DNS A record for sign.lexyalgo.com -> 37.27.49.209 before Caddy certificate issuance
docker compose up -d --build
```

Verification:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=200 server client caddy
curl -I https://sign.lexyalgo.com
curl -fsSL https://sign.lexyalgo.com/api/app/health || true
```

Then browser proof:

1. Load public URL.
2. Login through shared Supabase credentials.
3. Confirm `/billing` shows subscription status.
4. Subscribe via Stripe Checkout, then return to LexySign.
5. Upload PDF.
6. Place signer fields.
7. Send signing request.
8. Complete signer flow.
9. Download signed PDF and certificate/audit trail.
10. Confirm API-created document path works.

## Blockers before public launch

1. DNS for `sign.lexyalgo.com` must point at `37.27.49.209`, or pick a different hostname.
2. SMTP must be chosen/configured/tested. Mailpit/local capture is not real delivery.
3. Supabase production URL/anon key/server key must be set in `.env` so LexySign attaches to the shared Lexy backend.
4. Stripe product/price and webhook secret must be set in `.env` before subscriptions can activate.
5. The generated P12 is smoke-test only. It is not an Adobe-trusted signing certificate.
6. Backups/retention/object storage need a real decision before customers rely on it.
7. AGPL obligations apply: modified source must remain available to network users.
